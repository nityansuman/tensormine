## Requesting a Feature

You can also use Github issues to request features you would like to see in Keras, or changes in the Keras API.

1. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on library for Keras. It is crucial for Keras to avoid bloating the API and codebase.

2. Provide code snippets demonstrating the API you have in mind and illustrating the use cases of your feature. Of course, you don't need to write any real code at this point!

3. After discussing the feature you may choose to attempt a Pull Request. If you're at all able, start writing some code. We always have more work to do than time to do it. If you can write some code then that will speed the process along.
