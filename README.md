## You have just found TensorHub.

The open source library to help you develop and train models, easy and fast as never before with `TensorFlow 2.0`.
`TensorHub` is a global hub of `building blocks` and `ready to serve models`.

`TensorHub` is a library of deep learning models and neural lego blocks designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research.

Use `TensorHub` if you need a deep learning library that:
+ **Reproducibility** - Reproduce the results of existing pre-training models (such as Google BERT, XLNet).

+ **Model modularity** - TensorHub is divided into multiple components: ready-to-serve models, layers, neural-blocks etc. Ample modules are implemented in each component. Clear and robust interface allows users to combine modules with as few restrictions as possible.

+ **Fast** - Our custom utilities and layers are made from the ground up to support pre-existing standard frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras with efficiency in mind.

+ **Prototyping** - Code less build more. Apply `TensorHub` to create fast prototypes with the help of pre-cooked models, custom layers and utilities support.

+ **Platform Independent** - Supports both `Keras` and `TensorFlow 2.0`. Run your model on CPU, single GPU or using a distributed training strategy.

## Getting started: 30 seconds to TensorHub

Building a question answering system, an image classification model, a Neural Turing Machine, or any other model is just as fast. The ideas behind deep learning are simple, so why should their implementation be painful?

For a more in-depth tutorial about Keras, you can check out:

+ [Getting started with Text Classification](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples/text-classifier-using-tensorhub-models.ipynb)
+ [Getting started with Image Classification](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples/image-classifier-using-tensorhub-models.ipynb)
+ [Build your own custom Model](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples/working-with-custom-layers.ipynb)

In the [examples folder](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/tree/master/examples) of this repository, you will find much more advanced examples coming your way very soon.

## Installation

Before installing `TensorHub`, please install its backend engines: TensorFlow (*TensorFlow 2.0 is Recommended*).

+ [Install TensorFlow and Get Started!](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

+ [Build, deploy, and experiment easily with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You may also consider installing the following **optional dependencies**:

+ [cuDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/) (*Recommended if you plan on running Keras on GPU*).
+ HDF5 and [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html) (*Required if you plan on saving Keras models to disk*).

Then, you can install TensorHub itself.

```sh
sudo pip install -U tensorhub
```

If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:

```sh
pip install -U tensorhub
```

<!-- + **Alternatively: Install TensorHub from the GitHub source:**

First, clone TensorHub using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub.git
```

Then, `cd` to the TensroHub folder and run the install command:
```sh
cd tensorhub
sudo python setup.py install
``` -->
